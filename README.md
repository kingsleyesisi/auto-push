# Auto Push Repository Documentation

## Overview
The Auto Push repository is designed to automate the process of updating a file's content and pushing the changes directly to a GitHub repository. This project is particularly useful for scenarios where automation is needed for file updates and version control.

This project is written entirely in Python and leverages GitHub's API and Git commands to perform these operations. The repository is a great tool for developers, data analysts, or system administrators.

## Key Features
- **File Content Automation**: Automatically updates the content of a specified file.
- **Version Control Integration**: Pushes the updated file directly to the repository, maintaining version control.
- **Python-Based Implementation**: Entirely written in Python, making it easy to modify and integrate into other Python projects.
- **GitHub API Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with GitHub for remote repository updates.

## Requirements
To use this repository, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **Git**: Installed and configured with access to the repository.
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**:
  - A token with appropriate permissions to push changes to the repository.
  - [Create a token here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kingsleyesisi/auto-push.git

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

cd auto-push


3. Install the required Python dependencies:

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Ensure that the requirements.txt file contains all the dependencies used in the project.*



# Configuration

1. GitHub Personal Access Token

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project

Add the following line to the .env file:

GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token

Replace your_personal_access_token with your actual GitHub token


2. Specify the File to Update

Modify the Python script to include the path to the file you want to update

Ensure that the script contains logic for updating the file content as desired


3. Repository Configuration

Ensure the repository URL and branch name are correctly specified in the script




# Usage

1. Run the Python script to update the file and push changes to the repository:

python auto_push.py

(Replace auto_push.py with the name of the main script in the repository)


2. The script will:

Update the specified fileâ€™s content

Commit the changes with a predefined commit message

Push the changes to the configured branch of the repository




# Example Workflow

1. The script reads the file to be updated


2. It generates new content for the file based on predefined logic (e.g., appending a timestamp or updating data)


3. The changes are committed with a commit message like:

Auto update: <timestamp>


4. The changes are pushed to the repository using the GitHub API or Git commands



# Troubleshooting

1. Authentication Issues

Ensure your GitHub token has the correct permissions for the repository

Verify that the token is correctly added to the .env file



2. File Not Updated

Check the script logic for updating file content

Ensure the file path is correctly specified in the script



3. Push Errors

Verify that Git is installed and configured

Ensure you have write access to the repository
